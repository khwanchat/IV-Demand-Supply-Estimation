# 📊 Demand and Supply Estimation using IV Regression

This project estimates the demand and supply curves for a product using **instrumental variables (IV) regression** to account for the endogeneity of price.

---

## ⚙️ Model

- Used **Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS)** to estimate structural demand/supply equations.
- Instruments: [mention instruments used, e.g. cost variables or weather]
- Compared OLS vs. IV to demonstrate bias correction.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- Endogeneity and simultaneity in price/quantity
- Instrument validity: relevance and exclusion
- IV vs OLS estimation comparison
- Causal inference in economics
